This is a fork of
[CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion),
the open source text-to-image generator. It provides a streamlined
process with various new features and options to aid the image
generation process. It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux machines, with
GPU cards with as little as 4 GB of RAM. It provides both a polished
Web interface (see below), and an easy-to-use command-line interface.

# Getting Started with InvokeAI

For full installation and upgrade instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/)

1. Go to the bottom of the [Latest Release Page](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/releases/tag/v2.2.3)
2. Download the .zip file for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).
3. Unzip the file. 
4. If you are on Windows, double-click on the `install.bat` script. On macOS, open a Terminal window, drag the file `install.sh` from Finder into the Terminal, and press return. On Linux, run `install.sh`.
5. Wait a while, until it is done. 
6. The folder where you ran the installer from will now be filled with lots of files. If you are on Windows, double-click on the `invoke.bat` file. On macOS, open a Terminal window, drag `invoke.sh` from the folder into the Terminal, and press return. On Linux, run `invoke.sh`
7. Press 2 to open the "browser-based UI", press enter/return, wait a minute or two for Stable Diffusion to start up, then open your browser and go to http://localhost:9090. 
8. Type `banana sushi` in the box on the top left and click `Invoke`:

### Installation

This fork is supported across Linux, Windows and Macintosh. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver). For full installation and upgrade
instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/INSTALL_SOURCE/)

### Hardware Requirements

InvokeAI is supported across Linux, Windows and macOS. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver).
#### System

You wil need one of the following:

- An NVIDIA-based graphics card with 4 GB or more VRAM memory.
- An Apple computer with an M1 chip.

We do not recommend the GTX 1650 or 1660 series video cards. They are
unable to run in half-precision mode and do not have sufficient VRAM
to render 512x512 images.

#### Memory

- At least 12 GB Main Memory RAM.

#### Disk

- At least 12 GB of free disk space for the machine learning model, Python, and all its dependencies.

**Note**

If you have a Nvidia 10xx series card (e.g. the 1080ti), please
run the dream script in full-precision mode as shown below.

Similarly, specify full-precision mode on Apple M1 hardware.

Precision is auto configured based on the device. If however you encounter
errors like 'expected type Float but found Half' or 'not implemented for Half'
you can try starting `invoke.py` with the `--precision=float32` flag to your initialization command

```bash
(invokeai) ~/InvokeAI$ python scripts/invoke.py --precision=float32
```
Or by updating your InvokeAI configuration file with this argument.

Anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, whether documentation, features, bug fixes, code
cleanup, testing, or code reviews, is very much encouraged to do so. 

To join, just raise your hand on the InvokeAI Discord server (#dev-chat) or the GitHub discussion board. 

If you are unfamiliar with how
to contribute to GitHub projects, here is a
[Getting Started Guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github). A full set of contribution guidelines, along with templates, are in progress, but for now the most
important thing is to **make your pull request against the "development" branch**, and not against
"main". This will help keep public breakage to a minimum and will allow you to propose more radical
changes.

We hope you enjoy using our software as much as we enjoy creating it,
and we hope that some of those of you who are reading this will elect
to become part of our community.
