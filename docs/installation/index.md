We offer several ways to install InvokeAI, each one suited to your
experience and preferences.

1.  [Automated Installer](INSTALL_AUTOMATED.md)

    This is a script that will install all of InvokeAI's essential
    third party libraries and InvokeAI itself. It includes access to a
    "developer console" which will help us debug problems with you and
    give you to access experimental features.

2. [Manual Installation](INSTALL_MANUAL.md)

    In this method you will manually run the commands needed to install
    InvokeAI and its dependencies. We offer two recipes: one suited to
    those who prefer the `conda` tool, and one suited to those who prefer
    `pip` and Python virtual environments. In our hands the pip install
    is faster and more reliable, but your mileage may vary.

    This method is recommended for users who have previously used `conda`
    or `pip` in the past, developers, and anyone who wishes to remain on
    the cutting edge of future InvokeAI development and is willing to put
    up with occasional glitches and breakage.

3. [Docker Installation](INSTALL_DOCKER.md)

    We also offer a method for creating Docker containers containing
    InvokeAI and its dependencies. This method is recommended for
    individuals with experience with Docker containers and understand
    the pluses and minuses of a container-based install.
